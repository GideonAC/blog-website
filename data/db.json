No doubt the best aspect of The Signal-Man is the way Dickens establishes atmosphere. An example of this can be seen in the quotation above.Here, Dickens succeeds in creating a haunting, supernatural atmosphere by not only suggesting the narrator has left the natural world, but also by describing the setting much like a graveyard.",

      "title": "The Magic Shop",
      "body": "The Magic Shop is a curious tale that follows a father and sons experience of visiting a genuine magic shop. While the little boy explores the shop, seeing only joy and wonder, his father is confronted with much more sinister visions. The story therefore examines how we experience the world as children versus how we experience the world as adults. In doing so, The Magic Shop forces the reader to consider whether innocence and evil truly exist in the outer world, or whether these are merely determined by our own perceptions. Favourite Line: I felt him pull at something that clung to my coat-sleeve, and then I saw he held a little, wriggling red demon by the tail the little creature bit and fought and tried to get at his hand and in a moment he tossed it carelessly behind a counter… “Astonishing what people will carry about with them unawares!”",
